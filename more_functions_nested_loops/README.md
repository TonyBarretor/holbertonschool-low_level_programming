# MORE FUNCTIONS AND NESTED LOOPS
this are more nested loops functions

In Quizz, Question 5:

	The conditional while and others check if the condition inside the parentheses is true or false. In this caase I thought the loop will be infinete, but with this knowledge now I know the while check if the condition is true.So at the end, we have 0 = -1, so thats not true, and thats why the loop ends on zero. This FUNDAMENTAL concept is known as THRUTHINESS.
