	This also represents the size of the argv array.
	Argc starts the count from 1

argv
	 This is an array that contains the program command line arguments. So you enter the arguments to argv.
	It is an array of size argc. This means that argv is an array and also it will be the size of the arguments counted in argc.
	The first argument passed has the position 0.

NULL
	It is called a null pointer, so it means that is a pointer that does not point to any memory location. It is used to incate the absence of a valid pointer.
